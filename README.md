# portscanner
A very simple portscanner written in C.

I wanted to rehearse my C-skills with Socket and wrote a very simple (and pretty slow) portscanner.
Maybe some day I'll improve this further.

By using this tool you agree not abusing this on any ways (ie. portscanning hosts without their permission).

Works at least on Ubuntu 20.04.
1.) Edit the values (IP, port range).
2.) Compile by changing into this directory and type `make`.
3.) Start the program by typing `./main`.
